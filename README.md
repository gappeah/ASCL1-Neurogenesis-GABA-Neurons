# Transcriptional analysis of ASCL1 and the effects of neurogenesis in GABAergic Neurons by UP889480

My final year project which I completed in March 2021. 

* Neurogenesis refers to the process by which undifferentiated neural progenitor stem cells generate mature and functional neurons. One of the ways that neurogenesis is controlled is by ASCL1 which has roles in the central nervous system and areas of the peripheral nervous system. 
* ASCL1 is responsible for the differentiation of cortical interneurons which are derived from the ventral telencephalon from the MGE and CGE regions and are associated with the proliferation and differentiation of immature neurons. 
* Mutations in ASCL1 are associated with epileptic seizures and schizophrenia with strabismus. What is not known is the relationship between ASCL1 and its target genes and how they play in the development of GABAergic neurons specifically. 
* Using the Gene Expression Omnibus database and ArrayExpress, 5 datasets were obtained which contain RNA-Seq and microarray data which are processed using Galaxy and GEO2R to obtain gene lists containing both upregulated and downregulated genes. To observe which gene overlap between the datasets and find similar biological meaning between the datasets. The datasets were placed in a Venn diagram using InteractiVenn. 
* The gene overlap is processed in g:profiler and STRING to identify several proteins linked to ASCL1 and GABAergic neurogenesis: 
1. GAD2 and CALB1/2 are associated with synaptic communication.

2. GATA2 is associated with GABAergic differentiation, NOTCH2 inhibition promotes neural genes related to neurogenesis and PITX2's role appears to be confined in neurogenesis in the midbrain. 

3. Slit2 and its role remains unclear in the process of neurogenesis and may play a minimal role in neural differentiation and maintaining axonal morphology.
